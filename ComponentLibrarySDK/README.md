## Components

The library includes these core components:

- `Button`: Customizable button with multiple variants and states
- `TextField`: Text input field with validation

## Usage

Here's how to use the components in your project:

```jsx
import { 
  Button, 
  TextField, 
  Card, 
  Typography 
} from './lib/components';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <Card variant="default">
      <Typography variant="h2" color="#ffffff">
        Register Now
      </Typography>
      
      <TextField
        id="name"
        label="Your Name"
        value={name}
        onChange={setName}
        required
      />
      
      <Button variant="primary" size="large">
        Submit
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
